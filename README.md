# React-practice

This repository contains several projects built to learn React and accessory technologies. The projects range from simple todo apps to food ordering apps connected to external dummy Firebase databases. These projects cover a range of React topics including:

* functional components
* class-based components
* React hooks
* Styling and animating components
* Context
* Redux as an alternative to context
* Asynchronous code in React components and context/Redux
* Validating user input
* Authenticating users
* React router
* Next.js
* Incorporating TypeScript in React projects

Follow the instructions below to view any of these projects:

```bash

cd <desired subdirectory>
yarn install
yarn start

```

For the Next.js practice and project subdirectories, use `yarn dev` to start the development server and navigate to [localhost 3030](http://localhost:3030/) to view the app.
